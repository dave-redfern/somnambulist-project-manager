You will need to stop all services and rebuild the Traefik container, before it
can be used in this project.

Note: the PEM file must be added to your keychain / SSL auth list before accessing
any site, as it is untrusted.

On macOS add to your Certificates in KeyChain Access.app, or via CLI:
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k \"/Library/Keychains/System.keychain\" ${PWD}/server.pem
